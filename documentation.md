## Overview

This codebase is designed to generate professional-looking documentation for a given codebase using markdown conventions.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `ano-code` command to generate documentation for a specific directory.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for this project:

* `yaspin==3.1.0`
* `click==8.1.7`
* `groq==0.11.0`
* `openai==1.52.2`

## Code Structure

The codebase is structured into the following modules:

* `file_processing`: contains functions for processing files and directories.
* `ai_assistant`: contains classes and functions for interacting with the AI assistant.
* `consts`: contains constants used throughout the codebase.
* `llm_cli`: contains functions for interacting with the LLM CLI.
* `prompt_llm`: contains functions for generating prompts for the LLM.

## API Documentation

### file_processing Module

#### process_file Function

Reads the content of a file and returns it as a string.

* Parameters:
	+ `file_path` (str): the path to the file to read.
* Returns:
	+ `content` (str): the content of the file.

#### create_markdown_file Function

Creates a markdown file with the given content.

* Parameters:
	+ `filepath` (str): the path to the file to create.
	+ `content` (str): the content to write to the file.
	+ `encoding` (str): the encoding to use when writing the file (default: 'utf-8').

#### process_directory Function

Walks through the directory and reads each file's content into a string.

* Parameters:
	+ `directory` (str): the directory to walk through.
* Returns:
	+ `code` (str): the content of all files in the directory.

### ai_assistant Module

#### AIAssistant Class

Interacts with the AI assistant.

* Methods:
	+ `run_assistant`: runs the AI assistant with the given prompt and command.
		- Parameters:
			- `prompt` (str): the prompt to give to the AI assistant.
			- `command` (str): the command to give to the AI assistant.
		- Returns:
			- `result` (str): the result of running the AI assistant.

### llm_cli Module

#### LlmInterface Class

Interacts with the LLM CLI.

* Methods:
	+ `prompt`: generates a prompt for the LLM CLI.
		- Parameters:
			- `llm_options` (LlmOptions): the options to use when generating the prompt.
		- Returns:
			- `prompt` (str): the generated prompt.

## Usage Examples

To generate documentation for a specific directory, run the following command:
```bash
ano-code write-doc /path/to/directory
```
This will create a markdown file in the `./documentation` directory with the content of all files in the specified directory.

## Error and Debugging Guidance

If you encounter any errors while running the `ano-code` command, check the following:

* Make sure the directory path is correct and exists.
* Make sure the required dependencies are installed.
* Check the logs for any error messages.

## Searchable and Accessible

This documentation is designed to be searchable and accessible. You can search for specific functions or classes using the table of contents or the search bar.

## Consistent Style and Formatting

This documentation follows a consistent style and formatting throughout. Code blocks are used to display code examples, and bullet points are used to list items.

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

This documentation assumes that you have a basic understanding of Python and markdown. You will need to have the required dependencies installed to run the `ano-code` command.

## Maintenance Tips and Code Style

To contribute to this project, follow these guidelines:

* Use consistent naming conventions and coding style throughout the codebase.
* Use code blocks and bullet points to make the documentation easy to read.
